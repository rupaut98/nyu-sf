For data preparation, we collected over 100,000 product entries across various categories. We implemented a robust data cleaning pipeline that included:\n\n1. Text normalization and standardization\n2. Custom tokenization for product-specific terminology\n3. Handling of multilingual product descriptions\n\nFor model selection, we evaluated several BERT variants including DistilBERT and RoBERTa, ultimately choosing BERT-base due to its balance of performance and computational requirements. We fine-tuned using a combination of masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks.\n\nFor evaluation, we used:\n- ROUGE scores for description generation\n- F1 scores for feature extraction\n- Custom metrics for business-specific requirements\n\nWe achieved 95% accuracy in feature extraction and significantly improved description quality based on human evaluation.",

Batch processing: Developed a queue system for bulk processing\n4. GPU optimization: Used CUDA optimization and TensorRT\n\nThese improvements reduced our average inference time from 300ms to 70ms while handling 3x more concurrent requests.",
